(Otherwise, we use your user name to move work for others.)\r\n\r\nInvite all collaborators easily by sharing your board link with them (you can tweet public boards if you want to share your workflow with others.)\r\n![wafflesharepublic2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/100216/9798930/29caeca4-57d2-11e5-8658-15818742876e.gif)\r\n\r\n--\r\n## Step 5: Customize your board\r\n\r\n### Customize your board\r\nWant to add a column to your board or configure the way we automatically track your team's work?

You can map your columns to those labels, and issues will automatically populate in the appropriate columns. Or use the defaults and create new labels as needed.\r\n\r\n### Configure automatic work tracking to fit your workflow \r\nBy default, we send your pull requests into your Needs Review column and connect issues and pull requests together when you reference them with closing or connect keywords. We'll automatically move issues to Done when you merge work into your default branch too. But you can do so much more! We suggest [this workflow](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/Recommended-Workflow-Using-Pull-Requests-&-Automatic-Work-Tracking) for fast-moving development teams.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
